        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 1 - ONLINE STORE TERMS</h2>

          By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at
          least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or
          that you are the age of majority in your state or province of
          residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your
          minor dependents to use this site. You may not use our products for
          any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the
          Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not
          limited to copyright laws). You must not transmit any worms or viruses
          or any code of a destructive nature. A breach or violation of any of
          the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your Services.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 2 - GENERAL CONDITIONS</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse Service to anyone for any reason at any
          time. You understand that your content (not including credit card
          information), may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a)
          transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and
          adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
          Credit card information is always encrypted during transfer over
          networks.

        <p>
          You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit
          any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the
          Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is
          provided, without express written permission by us. The headings used
          in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit
          or otherwise affect these Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>
          SECTION 3 - ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are not responsible if information made available on this site is
          not accurate, complete or current. The material on this site is
          provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or
          used as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting
          primary, more accurate, more complete or more timely sources of
          information. Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own
          risk. This site may contain certain historical information. Historical
          information, necessarily, is not current and is provided for your
          reference only. We reserve the right to modify the contents of this
          site at any time, but we have no obligation to update any information
          on our site. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor
          changes to our site.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 4 - MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE AND PRICES</h2>
        <p>
          Prices for our products are subject to change without notice. We
          reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or
          any part or content thereof) without notice at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any
          modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the
          Service.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 5 - PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>
          Certain products or Services may be available exclusively online
          through the website. These products or Services may have limited
          quantities and are subject to return or exchange only according to our
          Refund Policy. We have made every effort to display as accurately as
          possible the colors and images of our products that appear at the
          store. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any
          color will be accurate. We reserve the right, but are not obligated,
          to limit the sales of our products or Services to any person,
          geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a
          case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of
          any products or Services that we offer. All descriptions of products
          or product pricing are subject to change at anytime without notice, at
          the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any
          product at any time. Any offer for any product or Service made on this
          site is void where prohibited. We do not warrant that the quality of
          any products, Services, information, or other material purchased or
          obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the
          Service will be corrected.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 6 - ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in
          our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person,
          per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders
          placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card,
          and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In
          the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt
          to notify you by contacting the e‑mail and/or billing address/phone
          number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right
          to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be
          placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and
          account information for all purchases made at our store. You agree to
          promptly update your account and other information, including your
          email address and credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we
          can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.

        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 7 - OPTIONAL TOOLS</h2>
        <p>
          We may provide you with access to third-party tools over which we
          neither monitor nor have any control nor input. You acknowledge and
          agree that we provide access to such tools ”as is” and “as available”
          without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and
          without any endorsement. We shall have no liability whatsoever arising
          from or relating to your use of optional third-party tools. Any use by
          you of the optional tools offered through the site is entirely at your
          own risk and discretion and you should ensure that you are familiar
          with and approve of the terms on which tools are provided by the
          relevant third-party provider(s). We may also, in the future, offer
          new Services and/or features through the website (including the
          release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or Services
          shall also be subject to these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 8 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>
        <p>
          Certain content, products and Services available via our Service may
          include materials from third-parties. Third-party links on this site
          may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated with
          us. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or
          accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any liability or
          responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any
          other materials, products, or Services of third-parties. We are not
          liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of
          goods, Services, resources, content, or any other transactions made in
          connection with any third-party websites. Please review carefully the
          third-party's policies and practices and make sure you understand them
          before you engage in any transaction. Complaints, claims, concerns, or
          questions regarding third-party products should be directed to the
          third-party.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 9 - USER COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS</h2>
        <p>
          If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (for example
          contest entries) or without a request from us, you send creative
          ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether
          online, by email, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively,
          'comments'), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction,
          edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any
          medium any comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under
          no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay
          compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments. We
          may, but have no obligation to, monitor, edit or remove content that
          we determine in our sole discretion to be unlawful, offensive,
          threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise
          objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these
          Terms of Service. You agree that your comments will not violate any
          right of any third-party, including copyright, trademark, privacy,
          personality or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree
          that your comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful,
          abusive or obscene material, or contain any computer virus or other
          malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Service or
          any related website. You may not use a false e‑mail address, pretend
          to be someone other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or
          third-parties as to the origin of any comments. You are solely
          responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no
          responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you
          or any third-party.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 10 - PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          Your submission of personal information through the store is governed
          by our Privacy Policy, which can be viewed here: [LINK TO PRIVACY
          POLICY]
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 11 - ERRORS, INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS</h2>
        <p>
          Occasionally there may be information on our site or in the Service
          that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may
          relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, product
          shipping charges, transit times and availability. We reserve the right
          to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or
          update information or cancel orders if any information in the Service
          or on any related website is inaccurate at any time without prior
          notice (including after you have submitted your order). We undertake
          no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Service
          or on any related website, including without limitation, pricing
          information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh
          date applied in the Service or on any related website, should be taken
          to indicate that all information in the Service or on any related
          website has been modified or updated.
        </p>
        <h2>SECTION 12 - PROHIBITED USES</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to other prohibitions as set forth in the Terms of
          Service, you are prohibited from using the site or its content: (a)

          misleading information; (g) to upload or transmit viruses or any other

          personal information of others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext,

          reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service or any related

          the Service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or
          otherwise made available via the Service, even if advised of their
          possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the

          incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability
          shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

          applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be
          severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not
